// Every tool is a thin wrapper over the same helpers the REST API uses — the

// given in a chat window and an answer given on the Reports page come from one
// implementation and cannot disagree.
//
// Two rules hold throughout:
//   1. A tool never sees a workspace id from the caller. The workspace is fixed
//      at construction from the resolved API key, so no argument a model can
//      invent reaches a tenant boundary.
//   2. Write tools are registered ONLY for a read_write key. A read key is not
//      told they exist, rather than being refused when it calls them.

const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `TimeTracker holds one workspace's tracked time: entries, projects, clients, budgets and timers.

Working with it:
- Date ranges are the USER'S local calendar days. Pass \`timezoneOffsetMinutes\` (JS getTimezoneOffset sign: west of UTC is positive) on any tool that takes one, or the range silently means UTC days.
- Call \`list_projects\` before anything that takes a project id; ids are opaque and must never be guessed.
- Use \`get_time_summary\` for "how much" and \`list_time_entries\` for "what was worked on".
- Money comes from each project's own hourly rate. A project with no rate contributes 0 to any amount — report that as "no rate set", never as "earned nothing".
- Drafted entries are PROPOSALS, not tracked time. They appear in no report and no total until a person reviews and confirms them in the app; \`draft_day\` creates them, it does not log time.
- Call \`list_clients\`/\`list_projects\` before \`create_client\`/\`create_project\` to check one doesn't already exist under a slightly different name — neither tool is idempotent, so a retry makes a duplicate.`;
