/**
 * The `YYYY-MM-DD` calendar day a UTC instant falls on in `timeZone`.
 *
 * The database stores instants; external systems (Workfront's `entryDate`,
 * Dynamics' `msdyn_date`) file work against a calendar day. Slicing the ISO
 * string takes the *UTC* day, which west of UTC rolls over during the working
 * evening — an 18:00 entry at UTC-6 was pushed under tomorrow's date, quietly
 * landing billable hours on the wrong day.
 *
 * Resolved per instant rather than from a single offset, so a backlog pushed
 * across a DST boundary still dates each entry by the rule in force when it was
 * tracked. An absent or unrecognised zone falls back to the UTC day: worse, but
 * it is what the caller would have got anyway, and a push must not fail over a
 * malformed preference.
