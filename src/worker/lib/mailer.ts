/**
 * Send one React Email template.
 *
 * The EMAIL binding's simulated builder overload isn't reliable in local dev
 * (Miniflare expects a raw MIME message), so the message is built directly —
 * this works identically in local dev and production.
 *
 * Lives here rather than in auth.ts because auth is no longer the only sender:
 * the digest cron uses the same path, and two copies of the MIME assembly would
 * drift on the first change to either.
 *
 * ## Why the bodies are base64'd by hand
 *
 * Left to itself, mimetext (3.0.28) writes the body as raw UTF-8 while
 * declaring `Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit`. That is a spec violation — 7bit
 * promises every octet is < 128 — and the 8-bit bytes get mangled downstream:
 * a `·` arrived as a replacement character and an en dash as a literal
 * `\u2013`. Asking it for `base64` or `quoted-printable` does not help; it
 * sets the header but does not transform the body.
 *
 * So the body is encoded here and handed over already-base64, with the header
 * to match. Verified end to end for the digest, magic-link, OTP and invitation
 * templates.
 *
 * This depends on mimetext passing `data` through untouched. If a future
 * version starts honouring `encoding` itself, this would double-encode and
 * every email would arrive as a wall of base64 — very visible, not silent. Any
 * mimetext upgrade should re-run that check.
 *
 * Subjects are NOT affected: mimetext already RFC 2047-encodes those correctly
 * (`=?utf-8?B?…?=`), which is why nothing looked wrong until a body carried a
 * non-ASCII character.
