 * blocks reading "Tr…". Measuring the pane fixes Split and phones with one rule,
 * and also responds to the sidebar collapsing, which no breakpoint would catch.
 *
 * Only ever reduces: a user who asked for Day never gets upgraded to Week
 * because their window is wide. Month is a dayGrid — it has no time axis and
 * stays readable at any width — so it passes through untouched.
 *
 * `paneWidth` of 0 means "not measured yet"; callers pass a viewport-derived
 * fallback so the first paint isn't chosen from a width of nothing.
