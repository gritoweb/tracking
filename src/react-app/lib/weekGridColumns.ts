/**
 * Column geometry shared by the two week grids — Timesheet and Planner.
 *
 * They are the same table shape with different cells, and they had the same
 * measurements typed out twice in six places each. The widths matter beyond
 * tidiness: the Project column's `left` offset must equal the Task column's
 * width or the second sticky column overlaps the first mid-scroll, and that is
 * exactly the kind of pair that drifts when it lives in two files.
 *
 * The small-screen sizes exist because the two label columns took 280 of a
 * 390px viewport, leaving about 110px of the scrollable week visible — one day
 * column and half of the next. At 196px the scroll is worth performing.
