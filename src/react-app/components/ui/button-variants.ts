// `border border-transparent bg-clip-padding` is the radix-maia base, and it
// is load-bearing rather than cosmetic: `focus-visible:border-ring` below sets
// a border *colour*, and Tailwind's preflight leaves border-width at 0, so on
// every variant that didn't declare its own border the focus border simply
// never rendered. Measured across the app: border-width was 0px on every
// button. DESIGN.md §7 documents focus as "border shifts to the ring color
// plus a 3px ring" — only the ring half was ever true here. A transparent
// base border also keeps the box identical between variants, so `outline`
// isn't quietly 1px tighter inside than `default`. Switch already did this.
//
// The press scale stays at 97% (DESIGN.md §7) but skips menu triggers, which
// is maia's `not-aria-[haspopup]` refinement: a trigger that shrinks while
// its menu is opening reads as two conflicting animations on one click.
//
// `aria-expanded` styling is the other convention worth taking — an open
// dropdown's trigger should look held-open, and none of these variants said
// so, so a `...` menu button looked identical open and closed.
