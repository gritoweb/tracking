# Time Tracker browser extension

A Manifest V3 Chrome extension that mirrors the [Time Tracker](https://tracking.gritoweb.com.br)
web app: start/stop and view your running timer from the toolbar, with a live
badge, and pre-fill descriptions from issue/PR pages. Starting a timer needs a
project, picked from the workspace's active projects grouped by client.

## Layout

```

## How it works

- **Auth:** the popup uses better-auth's standard `createAuthClient`
  (`lib/auth-client.ts`). The server's `bearer()` plugin returns the session
  token in the `set-auth-token` header; the client stores it in
  `chrome.storage.local` and re-sends it as `Authorization: Bearer`. The
  background service worker reuses that token to poll the running timer and
  update the badge. On a `401` the worker clears the token and the popup returns
  to the login form. There is no refresh token.
- **Server trust:** the extension is trusted by its pinned origin
  (`chrome-extension://<id>`) in the worker's `trustedOrigins`
  (`src/worker/auth.ts`) — not by disabling CSRF.
- **API base URL:** configurable in the popup's settings but validated against an
  allow-list (`lib/apiUrl.ts`: `tracking.gritoweb.com.br`,
  `localhost`/`127.0.0.1`) so the bearer token is never sent to an arbitrary
  origin.
- **Content script:** the `timetracker:sync` and `timetracker:assistant`
  (assistant nudge-dismissal) relays only run on the app's own origins; on
  GitHub/Jira/Linear it only reads the issue/PR title to pre-fill the
  description.

## Local development

The extension is built separately from the web app.

```bash
pnpm build:ext        # → dist/extension/ (the store package)
pnpm build:ext:dev    # → same folder, keeps the localhost:5173 dev origin
```

The app URL comes from `VITE_APP_URL` in the repo root `.env` (or the
environment). The production build **fails** without it instead of falling back
to localhost; only `--mode development` may. Outside development the build also
strips the `localhost:5173` match from the packaged `manifest.json`.

Then load it unpacked:

1. Open `chrome://extensions`, enable **Developer mode**.
2. **Load unpacked** → select `dist/extension/`.
3. Confirm the ID reads `nogikmhdpnnedmfldanickgpikmifcje` (pinned via the
   manifest `key`).
4. Run the app/API with `pnpm dev` (or point the popup's API URL at
   `https://tracking.gritoweb.com.br`), then sign in from the popup.

Rebuild after changes with `pnpm build:ext` and hit **Reload** on the extension
card. There is no HMR for the extension build.

Useful scripts:

- `pnpm build:ext` — build to `dist/extension/`.
- `pnpm build:ext:dev` — development build (`vite build --mode development`).
- `pnpm zip:ext` — build + package `dist/timetracker-extension.zip` for upload.
- `pnpm ext:id` — print the dev extension ID derived from the signing key.

first upload.
