 * The digest cron has no request to read a timezone from, so it works off the
 * offset stored on the user row. If that is never set, "yesterday" is computed
 * in UTC — which for a user west of UTC reports *today's* hours under a
 * "Yesterday" heading. That actually shipped and reached a real inbox.
 *
 * A preview send is often the first time anyone touches digests at all, so it
 * is also the first chance to learn which timezone their "8am" means. This pins
 * that the client's offset is both used and persisted.
