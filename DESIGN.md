# Design System: Time Tracker

## 1. Overview

**Creative North Star: "The Quiet Ledger"**

Time Tracker is a professional instrument, not a showcase. It exists to be trusted with a number that a client will see on an invoice, so it earns that trust through restraint: a calm, softened neutral ground carries the interface, and the one saturated color — a warm brand red — is spent only where it means something (the running timer, the primary action, a live indicator). Project and tag colors do the rest of the visual work, turning a dense week of client entries into something scannable at a glance without any single element shouting for attention.

The system explicitly rejects the generic SaaS-cream dashboard: no near-white cream body, no gradient-text hero metrics, no tiny uppercase eyebrow above every card, no identical stat-card grids with an orphaned empty cell. It also rejects enterprise-bloat density — Jira/ServiceNow-style overloaded toolbars and 40-field settings screens. Every dense surface (entry lists, detailed reports, many-project workspaces) still resolves cleanly at narrow widths: legends wrap instead of overflowing, stat strips reflow without empty cells.

**Key Characteristics:**
- A softened, warm-neutral ground in both themes — never stark black-and-white, never AI-cream.
- One saturated accent (brand red), spent deliberately: primary actions, the running-timer state, focus rings.
- Project and tag color are the secondary color system, chosen from a hue-alternated palette so adjacent items always read as visually distinct.
- Icon-only actions in dense toolbars, each with an accessible name — labels are reserved for controls that convey current state.
- Flat, layered-by-tone surfaces; elevation comes from a one-step lightness/darkness shift between background and card, not shadow depth.

## 2. Colors

The palette is a warm-neutral ramp (chroma nudged toward the brand's own red hue, not a generic warm/cream default) with one saturated primary and a hue-alternated set of secondary colors for projects and tags.

### Primary
- **Ledger Red** (`oklch(0.588 0.207 27.33)` light / `oklch(0.65 0.207 27.33)` dark): primary buttons, the running-timer indicator and pulse, active nav item, links. Used sparingly — most screens show it in one or two places, never as a background fill.
- **`--primary-foreground` is pure white**, not `oklch(0.985 0 0)`. On the brand red, `#fafafa` measures 4.40:1 and fails AA for every primary button label; white measures 4.59:1 — and `#ffffff` is what the button-primary spec below already documented, so the token had drifted off its own page.
- **Ledger Red as text** (`--primary-ink`, `oklch(0.5 0.19 27.33)` light / `oklch(0.76 0.19 27.33)` dark): the same brand red retuned for small text. `--primary` is calibrated as a *fill* behind white and fails WCAG AA as 11–12px type (3.59:1 on its own `/10` tint in light, 4.27:1 in dark). `--primary-ink` holds the hue and chroma and moves only lightness. Use it for the active nav label, the running-timer elapsed readout, and the billable indicator — anywhere the brand red is the text rather than the ground.

### Secondary
- **Project & Tag Palette** (18-color hue-alternated set, `worker/lib/colors.ts` `DISTINCT_COLORS` / `react-app/lib/colorUtils.ts`): red, blue, green, amber, violet, teal, pink, lime, indigo, orange, cyan, purple, rose, sky, emerald, yellow, slate, stone — deliberately ordered so consecutive auto-assigned colors alternate warm/cool instead of drifting through a single hue family. Applied to project swatches, tag dots, calendar event blocks (translucent fill + solid left border), and report breakdown legends.

### Tertiary
- **Semantic status** — success (`oklch(0.596 0.145 163.225)`, billable progress / confirmations), warning (`oklch(0.666 0.179 58.318)`, avg/day and caution states), destructive (`oklch(0.45 0.19 18)` light / `oklch(0.72 0.17 12)` dark, delete / discard actions and error states). Each has a paired `-foreground` token for on-color text.
- **`--success-ink`** (`oklch(0.468 0.145 163.225)` light / same as `--success` dark): success used as *text*. `--success` is calibrated as a fill and fails AA as small type on every light ground — 3.61:1 on card, 3.31:1 on muted/accent, 3.15:1 on its own /10 tint — and some call sites are 10px. Icon-only uses stay on `--success`; icons need 3:1 and clear it. Third of the same family as `--primary-ink` and `--warning-ink`, for the same measured reason.
- **`--warning-ink`** (`oklch(0.505 0.179 58.318)` light / same as `--warning` dark): warning used as *text*, exactly as `--primary-ink` is for the brand red. `--warning` is calibrated as a fill and fails AA as small type — 3.15:1 on card (the "Unverified" badge), 2.77:1 on its own `/10` tint (the warning Alert). Holds hue and chroma, moves lightness only. Worst measured ground is that `/10` tint at 5.36:1.

### Chart marks
Charts encode **billable**, not category: both bar charts stack `--success` (the part you invoice) under `--chart-ink-soft` (the remainder). Green means the same thing it means on the KPI strip's billable bar.

- **`--chart-ink-soft`** (`oklch(0.84 0.012 30)` light / `oklch(0.40 0.014 265)` dark) is the de-emphasized half of that stack. It must stay distinguishable from `--success` on **luminance alone**, since hue is the channel a colour-blind reader loses: measured 2.23:1 greyscale in light, 3.74:1 in dark, with stack position and a legend carrying the rest.
- There is **no `--chart-1..5`**. Those were stock shadcn values acting as a second categorical palette against `DISTINCT_COLORS`, and `--chart-1` flipped hue family between themes (orange in light, blue-violet in dark). Categorical colour comes from `DISTINCT_COLORS` everywhere, including the breakdown donut's client/task/tag fallback.
- Projects created without an explicit colour are assigned the first unused `DISTINCT_COLORS` entry **server-side** (`routes/projects.ts`). The schema deliberately has no colour default: a fixed one meant every project created via API, extension or seed came out the same sky blue.

### Neutral
- **Ground** (`oklch(0.988 0.0015 30)` light / `oklch(0.185 0.006 265)` dark): the page background. Warm-tinted off-white in light; soft charcoal with a faint cool tint in dark — never pure white or near-black.
- **Card** (`oklch(0.962 0.0025 30)` light / `oklch(0.228 0.007 265)` dark): a tonal step *away* from the ground, and the only thing separating a card from the page — cards carry no border and no shadow (§4). The direction differs per theme on purpose: in light a card **recedes** below the ground, in dark it **lifts** above it, because a card darker than an already-dark page reads as a hole.
- **Popover** (`oklch(0.995 0.001 30)` light / `oklch(0.228 0.007 265)` dark): dialogs, popovers, dropdowns, sheets. In light this stays the *lightest* surface in the system while cards recede, so an overlay reads as floating above the page rather than as part of it. This is why popover and card are no longer the same token.
- **Ink** (`oklch(0.22 0.006 30)` light / `oklch(0.96 0.003 265)` dark): body text, eased off pure black/white for a softer read.
- **Muted** (`oklch(0.936 0.003 30)` light / `oklch(0.28 0.008 265)` dark): secondary surfaces (sidebar, toolbars — a second neutral layer, per product-register convention), segmented-control tracks, disabled fills. It moved down with the card so a track still reads *on* a card.
- **`--muted-foreground` is tuned against its *worst* ground, not the page background** — muted/accent, where secondary text mostly sits (toolbars, sidebar, tab tracks, count badges). L 0.543 was calibrated against the old muted (0.965) and reaches only 4.19:1 on the current one. **L 0.523** clears AA on all five grounds: background 5.27 / card 4.88 / popover 5.38 / muted 4.52 / accent 4.52.
- **Border** (`oklch(0.898 0.003 30)` light / `9% white` dark): input outlines and internal dividers — always subtle, never a structural color. It no longer draws card edges; tone does that.
- **Border-strong** (`oklch(0.78 0.004 30)` light / `22% white` dark): row dividers in the dense surfaces only (entry list, timesheet grid). `--border` measures 1.21:1 on a card, which effectively vanishes across a 30-row list at low vision. This sits at ~1.8:1 — deliberately short of the 3:1 non-text target, because a 3:1 divider reads as a structural rule and breaks the quiet-ledger feel. Never use it for panels or inputs.

### Named Rules
**The One Accent Rule.** The brand red appears in at most one or two places on any given screen — the running state and the primary action. It is never used as a large background fill or decoration.

**Running is `--primary`; destructive is `--destructive`; they are not the same red.** They used to be the same red in all but name — `--primary` at hue 27.33 and `--destructive` at hue 27.325, 0.011 apart in lightness — which is a distinction a 1.5px progress bar cannot draw. `--destructive` is now 9 degrees off the brand hue and materially darker in light (0.45 vs 0.588) or brighter in dark (0.72 vs 0.65), so the pair separates on lightness as well as hue. Its foreground is ink in dark mode, as `--primary-foreground` already was: near-white on the dark-mode fill measured 2.69:1 and failed AA on every destructive button label. They are and the timer bar used to spend the destructive one on the running state — capsule tint, pulse ring, elapsed readout and the Stop disc — while the Discard button beside it, the only genuinely destructive control in the bar, was `--muted-foreground`. Red meant "recording" and "destroy" within 200px. Stopping a timer *saves* the entry; it is not a destructive act, and the Stop disc is `variant="default"` like Start. `--destructive` in the timer bar belongs to Discard and nothing else.

**The Warm-Neutral Rule.** Every neutral token (background, surface, muted, border) carries a slight chroma nudge toward the brand's own red hue (light mode) or a cool 265° tint (dark mode). Neutrals are never chroma-0 gray and never generic cream.

## 3. Typography

**Body Font:** Geist Variable (with `ui-sans-serif, system-ui, sans-serif` fallback)
**Label/Mono Font:** Geist Mono Variable (with `ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, monospace` fallback)

**Character:** One well-tuned variable sans carries headings, labels, buttons, and body — a second family (Geist Mono) appears only for tabular numbers, durations, and timestamps, where fixed-width digits matter for scannability. Fixed rem scale throughout, not fluid/clamp — this is a product surface viewed at consistent DPI, not a marketing page.

### Hierarchy
- **Display** (600 weight, 40px / `text-display`, 1.25 line-height): a panel's own name where it *is* the header, not a page heading sitting above other chrome — the task detail sheet's title.
- **Title** (600 weight, 20px / `text-xl`, 1.3 line-height): page headings ("Reports", "Settings").
- **Headline** (600 weight, 16px / `text-base`, 1.4 line-height): card titles, section headers.
- **Body** (400 weight, 14px / `text-sm`, 1.5 line-height): default UI text, descriptions, table cells. 65–75ch cap where prose appears (AI summary output); dense tabular data runs narrower.
- **Label** (500 weight, 12px / `text-xs`, 1.3 line-height): muted metadata, timestamps, badge text, form labels.
- **Micro** (500 weight, 10px / `text-micro`): the floor of the ramp, for chrome-level detail only — `kbd` shortcut chips, dense inline badges (entry-row tags, session badges), counts, and micro-metadata inside 16–20px-tall elements. Never for content the user reads as text; anything sentence-shaped belongs at Label or above.
- **Subtitle** (600 weight, 18px / `text-lg`): the step between Headline and Title, for dialog and alert-dialog titles and the timer's elapsed readout. Documented because five call sites already used it and the ramp pretended it didn't exist; `text-lg` is a named, greppable step, which is what the Named-Step Rule actually asks for.
- **Mono/Data** (500 weight, tabular-nums, Geist Mono): durations (`2h 15m`), elapsed timers, currency amounts — anywhere a column of numbers needs to align.

### Named Rules
**The Tabular Rule.** Any number that appears in a list or column (durations, currency, percentages) uses `tabular-nums` so digits align vertically. This is non-negotiable in reports and entry lists.

**The Named-Step Rule.** Every size above comes from a named utility — `text-display`, `text-xl`, `text-base`, `text-sm`, `text-xs`, `text-micro`. An arbitrary size anywhere in the app is drift by definition, even when the pixel value happens to match a step: it can't be changed centrally and it defeats the design-system check. There are now **zero** arbitrary font sizes in the app, and ESLint fails the build if one comes back (`no-restricted-syntax` in `packages/eslint-config/base.js`). This rule had been swept clean by hand more than once and grew back each time, because nothing failed when it did. (**Never write a utility class in backticks in a Markdown file.** Tailwind v4 scans `.md` too, so a class named in prose compiles a real, dead rule into the shipped stylesheet — name the CSS property instead. This has now bitten twice: once for arbitrary font sizes, and once for the background-clip utility, where §6's note that the assistant's gradient sweep had been *removed* was itself what kept regenerating that rule into the bundle and tripping the gradient-text detector on every route. Writing the class name here — even to warn about it, even with a leading dot — recompiles it, which is how this rule got its second bite. The named steps listed above are the exception that proves it: they are all real utilities the app uses.)

**The Spent-Figure Rule.** A `5h 30m / 90h` caption beside a progress bar ranks by *contrast*, not size: the spent value is `--foreground`, the thing it is measured against is `--muted-foreground`, and both stay at Micro. Three surfaces rendered this pair — project budgets, task estimates in the project drawer, task estimates in the board — and all three set the whole string at the smallest step of the ramp *and* the lowest contrast on it, which put the one live number in the row below the chrome around it. Micro is still correct (the Two-Tier Rule fixes it there, and a 12px caption under a 12px metadata line flattens the row rather than ranking it); the fix is that only half the string should recede. One component, `ui/spent-figure.tsx`, so the three can't diverge again.

**The One-Keycap Rule.** Every keyboard chip is `ui/kbd.tsx` — `Kbd`, or `KbdGroup` for a sequence. There were five hand-rolled `<kbd>` elements across four files in four different shapes (three heights, three paddings, two font sizes) for one element with one job, which is what happens when a Micro-tier detail is too small to feel worth a component. The canonical chip is 20px tall at Micro on `--muted` with a hairline; a longer label may widen its padding, nothing else varies.

**The Two-Tier Rule.** Where a dense element stacks a heading over its metadata — calendar blocks, table column headers, tool cards, entry rows — the heading is Label (12px) and everything beneath it is Micro (10px). No in-between size: an 11px middle tier is a near-miss that reads as sloppy rather than hierarchical, which is exactly what the app accumulated before this rule existed. The exception is a block whose *only* content is that one line (a `<code>` value you may need to read exactly) — that line is the heading tier, so it takes Label.

## 4. Elevation

The system is flat-by-default with tonal layering, not shadow-driven. This is now literally true: inputs, selects, textareas, switches and outline buttons each carried a `shadow-xs` while this section claimed overlay shadows were the only ones in the app. They no longer do — radix-maia puts no shadow on any control either, so the rule and the code finally agree. Depth is conveyed by a one-step lightness shift between the ground and the surface — **and by nothing else**. Cards have no border and no resting shadow: the tonal step already says "this is a surface", and a hairline plus a shadow on top of it are two more ways of saying the same thing. Thirty of them on a Settings page is most of its visual noise. The timer Start/Stop control is the one place that gets a distinct treatment, and it earns it with *color and motion* rather than dimension: a flat brand-tinted capsule with a ring breathing outward behind the disc (see §8).

### Shadow Vocabulary
- **Card rest: none.** Cards are separated by tone alone. There is no resting shadow anywhere in the system.
- **Overlay** (`shadow-md` / `shadow-lg`): popovers, dialogs and sheets, which float above the page and need to read as detached rather than layered. These are the *only* shadows in the app, and they are paired with the lightest surface token (`--popover`) so "floating" is said twice, consistently, rather than once each in two different vocabularies.

### Named Rules
**The Flat-By-Default Rule.** Surfaces are flat at rest, separated by **tone alone** — no border, no shadow. There is no gradient, inner-shadow or "lit-dome" depth anywhere — including on the timer control, which is a flat solid disc.

## 5. Components

### Buttons
- **Shape:** `rounded-full` on all sizes, including icon-only (which therefore render as circles). See The Geometry Rule below.
- **Primary:** brand-red background, white text, `hover:bg-primary/90`, active state scales to 97% — **except on menu triggers**, which are excluded via `aria-haspopup`. A trigger that shrinks while its own menu is opening plays two conflicting animations on one click. (This is radix-maia's `not-aria-[haspopup]` refinement; the app keeps its 97% scale rather than maia's 1px nudge.)
- **Every button carries a transparent 1px border** (`border border-transparent bg-clip-padding`). It is load-bearing, not cosmetic: the focus treatment below sets a border *colour*, and Tailwind's preflight leaves border-width at 0, so on any variant that didn't declare its own border the focus border never rendered — measured at 0px across the whole app. It also keeps the box identical between variants. Badge, Switch and TabsTrigger already did this (it is the radix-maia convention, five components wide); Button predated the v4 CLI migration and was the one that missed it.
- **Open state:** `outline`, `secondary` and `ghost` style `aria-expanded`, so a dropdown trigger reads as held-open while its menu is up. Without it a row's `…` button looked identical open and closed.
- **Outline:** transparent background, 1px border, `hover:bg-accent`. The default for secondary toolbar actions.
- **Ghost:** no border or fill at rest; `hover:bg-accent`. Used for tertiary/inline actions (row menus, dismiss buttons).
- **Destructive:** filled with the destructive color; reserved for delete/discard confirmations.
- **Icon-only:** always paired with `aria-label` + a native `title` tooltip. Use the canonical size tokens — `icon-xs` (24px, dense inline row actions), `icon-sm` (32px, toolbar actions — matches labeled `size="sm"` buttons), `icon-lg` (40px) — never an ad-hoc `h-N w-N` override; drift between icon and labeled buttons of the same conceptual size is a defect.

### Badges / Chips
- **Style:** fully rounded (`rounded-full`), 12px label text, 2px/8px padding.
- **Variants:** default (primary fill), secondary (muted fill), outline (border only, transparent fill), destructive.
- **Project/tag chips** additionally carry a small `ColorDot` (2.5px circle) in the item's assigned palette color before the label.

### Cards / Containers
- **Corner Style:** `rounded-container` (20px). Named rather than spelled as an arbitrary value so the container radius moves in one place.
- **Background:** `--card`, a measured tonal step from the page ground (§2 Neutral).
- **Shadow Strategy:** none at rest, and no hover elevation change.
- **Border:** none. Tone is the only separator.
- **Internal Padding:** 24px (`py-6` + header/content gutters).
- **The KPI-strip exception:** the Reports summary metrics render as one framed strip (flex-wrap, 1px internal dividers via `bg-border` gaps) rather than a grid of individual cards — this avoids the "identical card grid with an orphaned empty cell" anti-pattern when the visible metric count doesn't evenly divide the row.

### Inputs / Fields
- **Style:** 1px border, `bg-background`, `rounded-full`, **no shadow**. `Input` carries `px-4` so text is not crowded into the curve; **`SelectTrigger` stays at `px-3`** because it is `w-fit` in tight toolbars and the extra 8px truncated its value ("No sub-grou…") — a chevron already gives it the breathing room the pill needs. **Textarea is the deliberate exception** to the shape — it keeps `rounded-xl`, because a pill forces the first and last lines of multi-line text into the curve.
- **Focus:** border shifts to the ring color plus a 3px ring at 50% opacity — no glow, no scale change. **The focus ring is not the brand red.** `--ring` (`oklch(0.55 0.14 265)` light / `oklch(0.7 0.14 265)` dark) is deliberately a different hue from both `--primary` and `--destructive`: when they shared a value, a focused input read as a validation error and "Save changes" was the same color as "Discard". Hue 265 is the system's own cool tint from the dark ramp, not a stock blue. One focus vocabulary everywhere — no bare-underline substitutes.
- **Error:** border and ring shift to the destructive color at reduced opacity.

### Navigation
- **Sidebar:** icon + label nav items, `rounded-md` active/hover states, active item gets a `bg-primary/10` fill with primary-colored text and icon (not a full-color fill — this is the "One Accent Rule" applied to navigation). Collapses to a 56px icon rail; the collapsed state shows the brand mark itself as the expand control (no separate arrow button) — the logo never disappears when collapsed.
- **Tabs** (Reports Summary/Weekly/Detailed, Timer view switcher, Settings sections): segmented control, `bg-muted` track, active segment is a solid `--foreground` pill with `--background` ink (see The Segmented Rule below — this line used to describe the lift-to-`bg-background`-with-a-shadow treatment that rule replaced). Settings uses them to break 15 cards into four named groups, with the active tab in the query string so `/settings?tab=account` is linkable.
- **`SegmentedControl`** (`ui/segmented-control.tsx`): the same segmented shape for a *value* rather than a panel — theme and time format. Use it instead of hand-rolling a pill group; Settings had two of these diverging, one of which (theme) was a lone icon that never showed which of its three states was active.

### The Geometry Rule
Corner radius is chosen by **what an element is**, never by taste, and there are exactly three families:

- **Controls — `rounded-full`.** Buttons (including icon-only, which become circles), badges, inputs, segmented-control tracks and segments. A pill costs nothing at 24–40px and it is the loudest single cue in the system's shape language.
- **Containers — `rounded-container` (20px).** Cards, dialogs, sheets, popovers.
- **Data cells — `rounded-md` / `rounded-lg`, unchanged.** Entry rows, timesheet cells, calendar event blocks, planner cells, table cells.

The boundary between the families is **density**. Pills on a thirty-row entry list would trade the app's actual job — scanning a day of tracked time — for a look, so the geometry stops at the edge of the data. If a new surface is dense, it belongs to the third family no matter how it is built.

### The Segmented Rule
There are four segmented controls in the app — `SegmentedControl`, `Tabs` (default variant), `TimerViewSwitcher` and the calendar-view radiogroup inside `CalendarViewOptions` — and they must not diverge. That last one is the reason this is a written rule: it is a `grid`, not a flex row, so it did not match a search for the others and had been quietly drifting on its own. The active segment is a solid `--foreground` pill with `--background` text, on a `--muted` track.

It is deliberately **not** the brand red: the one accent is spent on primary actions and the running timer, and a settings row is neither. Ink-on-track is also the only "which one is selected" signal here that survives a colour-blind reader unchanged, because it carries no hue at all.

It replaced a lift-to-`bg-background`-with-a-shadow treatment, which stopped working the moment cards went borderless and recessed: the "lifted" segment and the surface behind it became the same value, so the control read as flat. Anything inside an active segment must use `--background`-derived ink, not `--muted-foreground`, which is tuned for light grounds and disappears on the pill.

### The Period Control Rule
The "Today" button is never hidden — visible-but-disabled when the period already contains today. It was briefly `invisible` + `aria-hidden` to avoid the label reading "Today Today", which traded an affordance for a cosmetic nit and fired at exactly the wrong moment: switching to Split collapses the period to a single day, so the one period control vanished from the screen and the a11y tree together. When the pane is too narrow for the requested calendar view, the header carries a "narrow pane" chip — that explanation previously lived only inside the View options popover, so the header total silently changed from a week to a day with nothing on screen saying why.

### The Dashed Rule
A dashed border means exactly one thing: **empty, click to fill.** The assign-project chip, the calendar's ghost blocks, and empty-state containers. It is never a "you can't" signal — locked cells (a multi-entry timesheet cell, a planner row with no project) read as `opacity-50` + `cursor-not-allowed`, and they use `aria-disabled` rather than `disabled` so they stay in the tab order and their `aria-describedby` explanation is actually announced. A `title` on a `disabled` button reaches nobody.

### Calendar Event Block (signature component)
Real tracked entries render as a translucent fill (16% opacity of the project/tag color) with a solid left-accent border in the same color — not a solid block, so overlapping context (now-indicator, grid lines) stays legible through it. Two distinct block styles share the same grid: **real entries** (solid border, translucent fill) and **unconfirmed calendar "ghost" events** (dashed border, near-transparent, cursor pointer, "click to track" affordance) — the two read as fundamentally different weights of interactivity at a glance without needing a legend.

## 6. Motion

Motion in a quiet ledger is confirmation, not performance. It exists to answer three questions — *did that register?*, *where did this come from?*, and *is this still running?* — and nothing else. Nothing bounces, nothing springs, nothing slides in to be admired.

### Duration Scale

Three steps, defined in `index.css` and consumed as `duration-fast` / `duration-base` / `duration-slow`. Pick by **how far the thing travels**, not by how important it is.

| Token | Value | For |
|---|---|---|
| `duration-fast` | 150ms | A state change in place: hover, focus, colour, a chevron rotating, a row tint. |
| `duration-base` | 200ms | Something appearing or leaving: dialogs, popovers, dropdowns, tooltips, entry rows, stat strips. |
| `duration-slow` | 300ms | A panel-sized move across the screen: sheets and drawers, the timer capsule opening. |

Numeric utilities (`duration-200`) still compile, but the named steps are the convention — they keep the scale greppable and let a retune happen in one place.

### Easing

`--ease-out-quart` (`cubic-bezier(0.25, 1, 0.5, 1)`) is **the** curve. Everything decelerating into place uses it; there is no separate "enter" and "exit" curve. `--ease-out-quint` is reserved for the single largest move — the timer control's width change — where a flatter tail keeps a wide element from appearing to overshoot. Looping opacity pulses (`animate-running-dot`) stay on `ease-in-out`, because a symmetric breathe wants a symmetric curve.

Stock `ease-out` / `ease-in-out` / `ease` and Tailwind's default curve are not part of the system. A bare `transition-colors` silently falls back to that default — always pair a transition with a duration and `ease-out-quart`. **ESLint enforces this** (`no-restricted-syntax`): a transition utility in a class string without `ease-out-qu` fails the build. Two hand sweeps had already closed this and it grew back both times.

### The Running State

The one motion the product is allowed to spend attention on, because "am I still tracking?" is the question the whole app exists to answer. It has **two forms and one cadence** — both loop at 1.6s, so when they share a screen (the sidebar readout sits directly under the timer bar) they breathe together instead of drifting against each other.

- **The signature** (`animate-recording-pulse`): a flat `--primary` ring scales outward from behind the Stop disc while the disc itself stays put — the visual equivalent of a recording light. Only ever on that one control. Keeps `ease-out-quart` because it *travels*.
- **The quiet one** (`animate-running-dot`): a small dot breathing in place, for dense surfaces — the sidebar's running readout, a running block on the calendar grid. Opacity only, because these sit inside rows where a scaling dot would nudge its neighbours. On `ease-in-out`, per the curve rule above.

These are the only infinite animations in the product. Adding a third form of "running" is the wrong move — extend one of these two.

### Busy vs. Not-Loaded-Yet

Two different states, two different components, and they are not interchangeable:

- **`Spinner`** (`components/ui/spinner.tsx`) — *this specific action is working*. Sizes are `sm` (14px, compact controls and row actions), `default` (16px, inside a default button), `lg` (20px, a whole panel or route). Never hand-roll `<Loader2 className="animate-spin" />`; that is how five sizes appeared for three jobs.
- **`Skeleton`** — *this surface hasn't loaded yet*. Preferred for anything with a known shape (lists, cards, tables) because it holds the layout instead of collapsing it and then shoving content in.

There is no third busy form. The assistant's "Thinking…" used to be a `background-clip: text` gradient sweep — a one-off reimplementation of `Spinner` wearing a paint job §7 explicitly forbids. It is a `Spinner` now, and the component, its keyframe and its token are gone.

### Named Rules

**The Confirmation Rule.** Motion confirms something the user did, or reports something that changed. It never decorates, never celebrates, and never delays access to content.

**The One Curve Rule.** `ease-out-quart` unless there is a stated reason otherwise — and the reason belongs in a comment at the call site.

**The Disclosure Rule.** Anything that opens or closes animates its *panel*, not just its chevron. `CollapsibleContent` carries the height animation by default (`duration-base`, `overflow-hidden`); a disclosure whose arrow rotates smoothly while its content snaps into place reads as broken.

**The Reduced-Motion Rule.** `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` collapses every animation and transition globally (`index.css`). Any effect whose *timing is coordinated in JS* — a row that waits for its exit animation before unmounting, a highlight that clears on a timer — must read the preference too and shorten itself; the CSS rule cannot reach a `setTimeout`. A running state must always survive the preference as colour and iconography, never as motion alone.

## 7. Layering

Four named tiers, registered in `index.css` as `--z-index-*`. The values are the ones the app already used by convention; naming them means a new surface picks a *meaning* rather than a number, and the order is greppable in one place.

| Token | Value | For |
|---|---|---|
| `z-sticky` | 10 | Headers and frozen first columns inside a scrolling grid. |
| `z-overlay` | 20 | Something covering a pane but not the app — the calendar's error wash, the ghost-count button, a sticky corner cell that has to win against its sticky neighbours. |
| `z-portal` | 50 | Dialogs, sheets, popovers, dropdowns, selects. |
| `z-tooltip` | 60 | Above portal on purpose: a tooltip on a control *inside* a dialog was previously the same 50 as the dialog and relied on DOM order to be visible at all. |

A raw `z-10` / `z-20` / `z-50` fails ESLint. Sonner manages the toast layer itself and is left alone.

## 8. Do's and Don'ts

### Do:
- **Do** keep the brand red to one or two elements per screen — the running-timer state and the primary action (**The One Accent Rule**).
- **Do** use the hue-alternated project/tag palette (`DISTINCT_COLORS`) for anything auto-assigned, so 2-3 adjacent items are never visually near-identical.
- **Do** use `tabular-nums` and Geist Mono for any number in a list or column.
- **Do** use the canonical `icon-xs` / `icon-sm` / `icon-lg` button size tokens for every icon-only button — never a hard-coded `h-N w-N` override.
- **Do** show a real empty state (icon + title + one-line description) on any chart, list, or breakdown that has no data — never a blank axis or silent nothing.
- **Do** let dense legends and stat strips wrap or reflow at narrow widths rather than overflow their container.

### Don't:
- **Don't** use a cream/sand/near-white body background — the "SaaS-cream dashboard" look is explicitly rejected. Neutrals carry a chroma nudge toward the brand's own hue, not a generic warm default.
- **Don't** use gradient-clipped text, tiny uppercase tracked eyebrows above every section, or identical stat-card grids that can orphan an empty cell.
- **Don't** reach for enterprise-bloat density — an overloaded toolbar, a nested-card layout, or a settings screen exposing everything at once. Reveal what the task needs.
- **Don't** add drop-shadow "lift" to cards, menus, or panels on hover — depth comes from tone and border, not shadow.
- **Don't** tint a progress track with the fill colour. A `bg-primary/20` track makes an empty bar read as a full one (`0m / 1h` looked identical in shape to a spent estimate), and spends the accent on work that hasn't started. The track is neutral; only a track that *means* something — `bg-warning/20` past 80% of a budget — overrides it.
- **Don't** paint a progress *fill* in the accent either. The default fill is `--foreground` — the same solid ink the segmented controls use for "this is the filled part". A red fill made every healthy project alarm about itself, and it left red unable to say "over budget", since the escalation at 100% is `--destructive`. **The budget ladder is ink → `--warning` at 80% → `--destructive` at 100%**, and it has to stay monotonic: three steps, three separable colours, each louder than the last. A caller overrides the fill only when the fill *means* something (`--success` for the billable share).
- **Don't** pair an icon-only button's `size="icon"` with an ad-hoc height/width override; use the size token so it matches its labeled siblings.
- **Don't** visually clone Toggl. Feature parity (calendar view, favorites, auto-track) is a gap-closing strategy — the soft-tone, red-accent identity is this product's own.

## 9. Brand Mark & App Icons

The brand mark is a **circled analog clock reading ~10:10** (the classic "watch ad" angle): a brand-red circle, a white ring at 90% opacity, two rounded white hands, and a center dot. It is the one place the brand red appears as a fill.

**Single source of truth:** `src/shared/brand-mark.ts` — glyph geometry (`clockGlyph`), face ratio, and the pre-converted sRGB hexes of the brand tokens for surfaces that can't use `oklch()` (static assets, email, OG image):

| Token | oklch | hex |
|---|---|---|
| Brand red (light `--primary`) | `oklch(0.588 0.207 27.33)` | `#dd322e` |
| Brand red (dark `--primary`) | `oklch(0.65 0.207 27.33)` | `#f34a42` |
| Ground light | `oklch(0.988 0.0015 30)` | `#fcfbfa` |
| Ground dark | `oklch(0.185 0.006 265)` | `#111315` |

**Two consumers, one geometry:**
- `src/react-app/components/brand/BrandMark.tsx` — the in-app mark (sidebar brand + collapsed-rail expand control, mobile top bar and nav sheet, login/signup). Fills the circle with `var(--primary)` so it tracks the theme.
- `scripts/generate-icons.mjs` (`pnpm generate-icons`) — every static asset: favicon (`logo.svg` + multi-res `favicon.ico`), PWA `any` + `maskable` icons, `apple-touch-icon`, PWA shortcut icons, OG share image, and the extension's four action icons.

**Named rule — One Clock.** No surface may draw its own clock glyph (including lucide's `Clock`) as a brand stand-in. The mark is always the shared geometry; change it in `brand-mark.ts` and re-run `pnpm generate-icons`. The lucide `Timer` icon in the nav is a *navigation* icon, not a brand mark — that distinction is the line.

**Satellite surfaces:** the extension popup consumes the same oklch tokens directly in its inline CSS (Chrome-only surface); transactional email uses the pre-converted hexes via `src/worker/emails/theme.ts` and a deliberately text-only header ("tracking.gritoweb.com.br") — no image logo in email, since image blocking would break it.
